It is assumed that you have some basic understanding of how to write in
LaTeX, how to install packages, and how to compile LaTeX.  If you do not,
you will need to seek tutorials on this subject. 

This template was designed so that you can focus on content and not on
presentation.  The following files may be edited:

* `myconfiguration.sty' - set your personal details such as your name 
   and thesis title, and any additional packages you wish to include.
* `mybibliography.bib' - your referenced materials.  A short selection 
   of Prof. Riehle's works have been included. 
* 'contents/zusammenfassung.tex' - if the thesis is being written in 
   English, remove the file.  This will change the document language to
   English and remove the unneeded Zusammenfassung section.
* 'contents/' - all files in this directory are meant to be edited.
   Section headings should be retained when they are provided, if
   applicable.  The existing content is provided only as a guide or
   example.

We are making use of BibLaTeX instead of BibTeX. If you have not used
BibLaTeX before you may need to install 'biber'. BibLaTeX is a modern
bibliography tool which has more robust handling of unicode and URLs.

If you notice an error and make a correction to another file, please
inform us so that we can fix the template. This template is maintained
